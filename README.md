# Movie Recommendation Algorithm

I made this Project for MS Engage 22. You can access the frontend at [matinee](https://github.com/deveshXm/matinee)

I have made this project in Jupyter Notebook and I used Cosine similarity algorithm to train model. 
I deployed the Model using Python FastAPI.

Installation

Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/deveshXm/movie-recommendation-algorithm.git
```

Run the following Command to host the FastAPI Locally

```
